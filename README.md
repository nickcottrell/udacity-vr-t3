# Udacity VR Developer Course - Term 3
This is where the program starts to specialize in specific areas. I chose Mobile Performance & 360 Media because I believe that the future of VR is mobile and will require knowledge about getting the most out of the graphics processor of whichever devices are being used at the time. This final course covers everything from performance analytics, profiling the graphics pipeline, video editing and processing, and more advance scripting. I believe this course, combined with my experience with Mobile VR and Augemented Reality will help set me apart in this early forming Mixed Reality industry.

## Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project, we were given a functioning game that has serious performance issues that prevent it from running on mobile. To improve the performance, I had to use the profiler tool to better understand performance bottlenecks. To get it running at a high frame rate on mobile (60+FPS), I had to replace high-polygon models with low-polygon models, use a combination of baked and dynamic lighting, and refactor the C# code to make it more efficient and less taxing on the system.

## Memory Machine
In this process I used 360 video stitching software to generate professional 360 videos. I used Adobe Premier to edit the footage. I created a 360 Video Player in Unity to add controls while users watch the videos. In the immersive VR experience, users select video content presented in context to the location it was taken. The result is an original experience that is immersive and gives a sense of nostalgia for the content.

##CAPSTONE PROJECT
The capstone project for the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree Program is designed to showcase a range of skills. For this project called "Ready Pirate One", I chose to make a pirate-themed platformer game that requires the player to search levels for hidden clues, ultimately unlocking the final treasure.
